# RaspberrySensor

Using a DHT11 sensor, we are trying to extract temperature and humidity readings for the environment and then upload our findings onto a realtime database created within Google Firebase. We use a raspberry pi as a suitable 'middleman' interface as it contains GPIO pins which would not available on modern desktops. We also write a python code to connect Jupyter Notebook to our Google Firebase  project and upload our findings.
